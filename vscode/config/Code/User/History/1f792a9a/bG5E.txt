job is an executable that keeps running
retries read of EVENT_FILE at every POLL_INTERVAL
searches for current_position in METADATA_FILE
reads form current_position to EOF in EVENT_FILE
parses string
for every new event
	pushes event to pending_job_queue

thread_pool_manager keeps consuming pending_job_queue
	when job available keeps looking for available thread on thread_status_list
	sends job to available thread
